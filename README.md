# Android Auto Format EditText
A customizable solution for automatic text field formatting and masking in Android applications. The AutoFormatEditText component extends from AppCompatEditText and handles the automatic real-time formatting of content such as dates, credit card numbers, and phone numbers. An abstract class AbstractAutoEditText can be implemented more fine grained control over the behavior.

## Example
```xml
<com.ibm.autoformatedittext.AutoFormatEditText
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="@{viewModel.formattedText}"
    app:format="(###) ###-####"
    app:rawValue="@={viewModel.unformattedText}"
    app:placeholder="#" />
```

## Description

The following describes in more detail all custom attributes used by AutoFormatEditText:
* **text** - The formatted string content of the edit text
* **format** - Used to derive the formatted string. The places for a user's input characters are denoted by a placeholder character (default is #). All other characters are literal and are inserted as the text changes. For example, a date format might be ##/##/####
* **rawValue** - The unformatted value of the data entered into the text field. It can also be thought of the actual characters that the user types. For example, a date entered with the format ##/##/#### and the text 07/19/1993 would have a raw value of 07191993. This is also called the "unformatted text"
* **placeholder** - An optional attribute specifying the character used by the text format to represent the user's inputed characters. This character MAY be inputted by the user without side effects
